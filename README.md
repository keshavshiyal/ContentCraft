# 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. You select content type.
2. You enter topic and details.
3. The system sends a request to Google Gemini AI.
4. AI generates structured academic content.
5. You can copy or export it.

---

# ⚠️ Important

AI-generated content should always be reviewed before official submission.

ContentCraft is a productivity assistant — not a replacement for academic judgment.

## ⚠️ Important Usage & Quota Note

**ContentCraft** relies on the Google Gemini API. Please be aware of the following:

* **Token Usage:** Every time you click "Generate," the tool sends a request to Google. This consumes "tokens."
* **Quota Limits:** If you are using the free tier of Gemini, there are limits on how many requests you can make per minute/day.
* **Recommendation:** To avoid errors, we recommend waiting **at least 5 minutes** between generating large documents to ensure your quota resets.
