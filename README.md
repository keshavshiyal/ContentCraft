### Step 1: Set Up XAMPP

## ⚠️ Important Usage & Quota Note

**ContentCraft** relies on the Google Gemini API. Please be aware of the following:

* **Token Usage:** Every time you click "Generate," the tool sends a request to Google. This consumes "tokens."
* **Quota Limits:** If you are using the free tier of Gemini, there are limits on how many requests you can make per minute/day.
* **Recommendation:** To avoid errors, we recommend waiting **at least 5 minutes** between generating large documents to ensure your quota resets.
